THE IDEA:
We want to create a convenient solution to avoid crowd in waiting scenarios. Our website will allow the user to arrive at a particular location just in time. The user will be notified via email when itâ€™s time to go. Initially the website focuses on the healthcare employees and patients but it can be used to serve any case regarding crowded locations.
